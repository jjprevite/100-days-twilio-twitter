# 100-days-twilio-twitter
An app to help you keep track of your #100DaysOfCode progress. It keeps track of what day you're on, lets you send a text with what you worked on that day to post to Twitter and all you have to worry about it coding :) ðŸ˜ƒ

## How does it work?
Using Twilio's API and Twitter's API, you send a text message to your Twilio phone number. You then configure it to make a POST request, which triggers the `app.js` which is built on Node.js and Express.js which then takes the body of the text message and tweets it.
