# 100-days-twilio-twitter

An app to help you keep track of your #100DaysOfCode progress. It keeps track of what day you're on, lets you send a text üì± with what you worked on that day to post to Twitterüê¶, commit your log to a Markdown file on GitHub, and all you have to worry about is coding üï∫üèªüíÉüèª

## How does it work? ü§î

Using Twilio's API, Twitter's API, and GitHub's API, you send a text message to your Twilio phone number. You then configure it to make a POST request, which triggers the `app.js` which is built on Node.js and Express.js which then takes the body of the text message, tweets it and posts it to a file on GitHub.

## Getting Started üòÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Here's what you'll need:

```
node v9.8.0
npm 5.6.0
```

* Basic JavaScript/Node.js experience
* Cell phone with texting capabilities

### Installing üíª

In order to get everything set up correctly, follow the steps listed below:

1.  Clone or (fork this repo)[https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-twilio-twitter#fork-destination-box] üç¥

```
git clone https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-twilio-twitter.git
```

2.  Change directories into the root folder ‚û°Ô∏è

```
cd 100-days-twilio-twitter
```

3.  Install the necessary dependencies üíø

```
npm install
```

4.  Update `API_URL` and `FILE_LOCATION_URL` variables in your project:

* `API_URL` will be your Firebase Database URL. It should look something like 'https://my-app.firebaseio.com/round1.json'

- Note: with Firebase, the database has a JSON-like structure. This is why we've added `round1.json` to the end of the root URL.

* `FILE_LOCATION_URL` will be the location of the Markdown file you want your logs saved to. The format is as follows: `https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/contents/:path`. Here's an example: `https://api.github.com/repos/jjprevite/100-days-twilio-twitter/contents/logs.md`


5.  Create a `.env` file inside the root using either your text editor or from the command line üìÅ

```
touch .env
```

We'll use this to store our environment variables, specifically API keys. Don't worry, the `.gitignore` file already includes a `.env` file so there's no risk of you accidentally exposing your API keys to the eyes of GitHub üòâ

Here's what it should look like:

```
NODE_ENV=dev
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
ACCOUNT_SID=
AUTH_TOKEN=
PHONE_NUMBER=
TWILIO_NUMBER=
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=
NAME=
EMAIL=
```

6.  Get your variables and add them to your `.env` file üìù

* `TWITTER...` these four variables will come from your Twitter "app", which you set up at [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/).

* `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN` will come from your Twilio account.

* `PHONE_NUMBER` is your phone number or the number of the phone you'll be using to send texts

* `TWILIO_NUMBER` you'll need to "buy" a phone number from Twilio. When you sign up, you should receive some credit so you shouldn't need to actually spend money to get a number. Here's a [quick guide](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Purchase-Twilio-Phone-Numbers-from-Console) on how purchase a Twilio number.

* `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` your auth token is 'username:password' based64 encoded. Here's an example:
```
//GitHub username: johnsmith1
//GitHub password: password1
const GITHUB_AUTH_STRING = "johnsmith1:password1";
console.log(btoa(GITHUB_AUTH_STRING));
//returns am9obkBzbWl0aC5jb206cGFzc3dvcmQx=
//you put this^(without the equal sign) in your .env for your GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN
```

* `NAME` is as you would guess, your name. First and last. This is used for committing on GitHub. Put your name like so "John Smith" with a space in between.

* `EMAIL` is the email you have registered with GitHub.

7.  Generate and create a `serviceAccountKey.json` file to hold your Firebase key üóù

Luckily, the Firebase documentation explains exactly how to do that. Follow [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/auth#generate_an_access_token) to generate a new private key. After you generate it, you should get your `serviceAccountKey.json` file. Add that to the root directory. It will be used to authenticate our REST requests.

8.  Take a quick tea üçµ break - we're almost there üòÑ

9.  Start your app by running this from the command line

```
npm run dev
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see the following printed to your node console:

```
Express server listening on port 1337. Let's get coding üéâ !
```

10. Expose your port using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) so we can connect our Node app with Twilio

* If you're on Mac, I recommend installing `ngrok` globally

```
npm install -g ngrok
```

Then run the following command in a new command line window to expose port 1337:

```
ngrok http 1337
```

If you're successful, you should see something like this:

![ngrok screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/WRJ2rZH.png)

11. Configure your Twilio number to listen for POST requests.

In order to do this we need to copy the forwarding URL from that command line window where `ngrok` is running. It should look something like this: `http://1962da97.ngrok.io` _It shouldn't matter if you use the `http` or `https` URl_

a. Open up the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console)
b. Navigate to your [Phone Numbers](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming)
c. Click the number you want to use
d. Scroll down to "Messaging"
e. Add your link to "A MESSAGE COMES IN" with `/sms` at the end. So it should look similar to:

![Adding ngrok URL to Twilio Phone Number](https://i.imgur.com/c5KWmx9.png)

üõë **IMPORTANT** üõë

> Because we are using the free version of ngrok. Anytime you start/stop `ngrok` you will get a new URL and have to go back in to Twilio's Console and add the new URL. Yes, this can be annoying for testing but if you want to upgrade, ngrok has a [$5/month tier](https://ngrok.com/pricing) where you get 3 reserved domains.

12. Send a text message to your Twilio phone number, check Twitter and check GitHub to see the magic happen üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Deployment

Deploying this small Node.js app is simple with services like [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). There are a few steps, which I will walk you through here:

1. Get Heroku set up locally - here's a [quick tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
2. Run `heroku create` inside the root directory.

3. This is where it gets a little trickier. You have to be extremely careful here so please **read carefully**. If you don't follow this correctly, you'll risk exposing your API keys.

  a. Create a new branch called `production`
      ```
      git checkout -b production
      ```
  b. Inside your `.gitignore` file, remove this line:
      ```
      serviceAccountKey.json
      ```
      We need to have this file in production so we have to remove it from `.gitignore`. But whatever you do, do not push this       to GitHub.
  c. Stage these files and commit (*note: this does not push them to GitHub*)
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "remove serviceACcountKey.json from gitignore for Heroku"
     ```
  d. Now push this branch to Heroku (NOT GITHUB)
     ```
     git push heroku production:master
     ```
     This means we are pushing this branch to production for our app to run. Whenever you make future changes, you will need        to pull your `master` branch into `production`. Never run `git push -u origin production` - that will expose your              serviceAccountKey.
  e. Last step is to add our environment variables. You can do this by navigating to the [Heroku dashboard] page(https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/). Click on your app, navigate to "Settings" and select "Reveal Config vars". Here is where you'll copy your variables from your `.env` file.

  f. Since we've changed the variables, we need to restart our app. You can do so from the command line by running `heroku restart` or by clicking "More" next to "Open app" in the dashboard and selecting "Restart all dynos"

  g. BOOM! You've deployed your `100-days-twilio-twitter` app! Start texting and coding away! ü§™
