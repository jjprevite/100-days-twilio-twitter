# twilio-twitter
A simple app that tweets a text message using Twilio and Twitter.


## How does it work?
Using Twilio's API and Twitter's API, you send a text message to your Twilio phone number. You then configure it to make a POST request, which triggers the `app.js` which is built on Node.js and Express.js which then takes the body of the text message and tweets it.
