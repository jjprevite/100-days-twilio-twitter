# 100-days-twilio-twitter
An app to help you keep track of your #100DaysOfCode progress. It keeps track of what day you're on, lets you send a text üì± with what you worked on that day to post to Twitterüê¶ and all you have to worry about it coding üï∫üèªüíÉüèª

## How does it work? ü§î
Using Twilio's API and Twitter's API, you send a text message to your Twilio phone number. You then configure it to make a POST request, which triggers the `app.js` which is built on Node.js and Express.js which then takes the body of the text message and tweets it. 

## Getting Started üòÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Here's what you'll need: 

```
node v9.8.0
npm 5.6.0
```

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account (free)
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) account (free)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signup?lang=en) account (free)
- [Twitter "App"](https://apps.twitter.com/) (free)
- Cell phone with texting abilities 

### Installing üíª

In order to get everything set up correctly, follow the steps listed below: 

1. Clone or (fork this repo)[https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-twilio-twitter#fork-destination-box] üç¥

```
git clone https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-twilio-twitter.git
```

2. Change directories into the root folder ‚û°Ô∏è

```
cd 100-days-twilio-twitter
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies üíø

```
npm install
```
4. Create a `.env` file inside the root using either your text editor or from the command line üìÅ

```
touch .env
```

We'll use this to store our environment variables, specifically API keys. Don't worry, the `.gitignore` file already includes a `.env` file so there's no risk of you accidentally exposing your API keys to the eyes of GitHub üòâ

Here's what it should look like: 

```
NODE_ENV=dev
API_URL=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
ACCOUNT_SID=
AUTH_TOKEN=
PHONE_NUMBER=
TWILIO_NUMBER=
```

5. Get your variables and add them to your `.env` file üìù

- `API_URL` will be your Firebase Database URL. It should look something like 'https://my-app.firebaseio.com/roundOne.json'
* Note: with Firebase, we're not creating a "real" database, rather a JSON file that will store our tweets. This is why we've added `roundOne.json` to the end of the root URL.

- `TWITTER...` these four variables will come from your Twitter "app", which you set up at [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/). 

- `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN` will come from your Twilio account.

- `PHONE_NUMBER` is your phone number or the number of the phone you'll be using to send texts

- `TWILIO_NUMBER` you'll need to "buy" a phone number from Twilio. When you sign up, you should receive some credit so you shouldn't need to actually spend money to get a number. Here's a [quick guide](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Purchase-Twilio-Phone-Numbers-from-Console) on how purchase a Twilio number.

6. Generate and create a `serviceAccountKey.json` file to hold your Firebase key üóù

Luckily, the Firebase documentation explains exactly how to do that. Follow [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/auth#generate_an_access_token) to generate a new private key. After you generate it, you should get your `serviceAccountKey.json` file. Add that to the root directory. It will be used to authenticate our REST requests.

7. Take a quick tea üçµ break - we're almost there üòÑ

8. Start your app by running the follow command from the command line

```
nodemon app.js
```
