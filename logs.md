# 100DaysOfCode - Round 4
To keep track of my tweets and what I'm learning, I've created this "logs" file.

## Logs
Take a look at what I've worked on each day. (P.S. - I added this feature after Day 2, hence this missing days.)

### Day 23: 7/10/2018
Tonight I started learning about @graphql on the "How to GraphQL" website. Definitely recommend checking out 👍🏼

Hoping I can implement GraphQL in a project soon! 😁
### Day 24: 7/14/2018
Today I went through the first two days of a @figmadesign tutorial by @trydesignlab - remembering how much I love Figma and want to use it to get better at UI design 😍
### Day 25: 7/14/2018
Today's session including another tutorial on @figmadesign and some Redux exercises on @freeCodeCamp. Finally feeling like I have a handle on Redux! 🙌🏼 It feels soooo good 😁
