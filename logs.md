# 100DaysOfCode - Round 4
To keep track of my tweets and what I'm learning, I've created this "logs" file.

## Logs
Take a look at what I've worked on each day. (P.S. - I added this feature after Day 2, hence this missing days.)

### Day 23: 7/10/2018
Tonight I started learning about @graphql on the "How to GraphQL" website. Definitely recommend checking out 👍🏼

Hoping I can implement GraphQL in a project soon! 😁
### Day 24: 7/14/2018
Today I went through the first two days of a @figmadesign tutorial by @trydesignlab - remembering how much I love Figma and want to use it to get better at UI design 😍
### Day 25: 7/14/2018
Today's session including another tutorial on @figmadesign and some Redux exercises on @freeCodeCamp. Finally feeling like I have a handle on Redux! 🙌🏼 It feels soooo good 😁
### Day 26: 7/15/2018
Woo! Finished another @figmadesign tutorial - my "app" is starting to look more realistic (will post screenshots in thread) 😋

Planning to study more Redux on @freecodecamp and look at open issues on @gatsbyjs repo in preparation for tomorrow's pair-programming 🕺

### Day 27: 7/17/2018
Another day working in @figmadesign - I made a sweet prototype (gif in thread).  Building wireframes and UI is getting me excited! 🕺

Also completed all React/Redux challenges on @freecodecamo and submitted 2nd PR to @gatsbyjs 😋
### Day 31: 8/5/2018
😮 Moment of truth. I had to update git credentials in my twilio-twitter app so hoping this fix worked! 

📅 Also had a weird timezone bug I think I fixed. Let's hope it all worked!

😄 More coding later today too! Will share in thread
