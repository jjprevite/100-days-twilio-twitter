### Day 35: 8/11/2018
Continued working on the chrome extension I'm building. I got the date picker working but the CSS needs some work. 😛

### Day 36: 8/14/2018
Found 20 mins to work on Chrome extension. I wish I could take a weekend in an @airbnb to go code and finish this thing up 😂 but hey, progress everyday is better than big gaps in development! 

### Day 37: 8/17/2018
Finally got the date picker and time picker working on my Chrome extension! 🙌🏼 The CSS will need a touch up or two but the logic works. Next step is constructing a URL with values! 

### Day 38: 8/18/2018
Today I worked on my chrome extension. The first part is done. The next part is to build the site that the Chrome extension links too. Hoping to build it with @gatsbyjs 💜

### Day 45: 9/2/2018,
Today's been quite the day. I finished Week 6 of CS50 and started working on the Survey Form project for freeCodeCamp. Trying TDD by writing my tests first - learning a lot 😁

### Day 46: 9/3/2018,
Finished setting up basic tests for @freecodecamp Survey Form - excited because I'm turning this into a "real" project I'm going to use on my new website 😀

### Day 47: 9/4/2018,
Spent more time working on the Survey Form - battled with testing a bit. It was only because I cleaned up the DOM after the first test so of course I couldn't find the elements to test 😂

### Day 48: 9/5/2018,
Continued working on SurveyForm. Really enjoying react-testing-library so far. Almost finished with the HTML for my form, then next is styling with styled-components 💅

### Day 49: 9/6/2018,
Added styled-components to my project. Next step is to go into @figmadesign and create the UI for my survey form so it's nice and pretty 🙂

### Day 50: 9/7/2018,
Continued working on Survey Form. Couldn't get the form submissions to come in - need to do more investigating to figure it out. 🤪 

### Day 51: 9/9/2018,
Finished the @freecodecamp survey form project today! Learned a lot of testing 😁

Also made good progress on MITx - 6.00.1x currently on Week 1. 

### Day 52: 9/10/2018
Continued working on 6.00.1x - onto the problem sets for Week 1. Learning Python is kinda fun! Reminds me of what it's like to be a newbie again 🤓

Also fixed two bugs on survey form 

### Day 53: 9/13/2018
Today was a big success! 🙌🏼 Worked on 6.00.1x - solved the last problem in pset1 in Python. Slowly getting better at writing algorithms and understanding compsci fundamentals. 😄

### Day 54: 9/14/2018
Made some good progress on 6.00.1x - almost done with Week 3. Last thing I need to do is finish guessing exercise for secret number 

### Day 55: 9/16/2018
Worked on 6.00.1x - finished exercises and videos for Week 2. Next up is pset2. Also started working on next fCC project but realized I need to migrate @gatsbyjs site from v1 to v2 

### Day 56: 9/23/2018
Completed Week 3, 5. Tuples and Lists for MIT 6.00.1x - next up is learning about Dictionaries (which I believe are equivalent to objects in JS) 

### Day 57: 9/26/2018
Continued working in MIT 6.00.1x - learned how Lists in Python are like Arrays in JS, and Dictionaries are like Objects in JS
